## Dev Iteration Flow

After you've added a feature run `mise build` to verify it builds.

If you need runtime logs, `mise install-emulator --logs` runs it in an emulator and prints logs to the terminal. The process stays alive until the emulator is closed

## Debugging

- C: `APP_LOG(APP_LOG_LEVEL_DEBUG, "msg", args)`
- JS: `console.log("msg")`

## JavaScript Conventions

- For new JavaScript functions, add brief JSDoc (`@param`/`@returns`) annotations since this project does not use TypeScript.
- Prefer `Boolean(value)` over `!!value` in new/edited code for readability.

## Supabase migrations

Never write `migrations/` files manually. Edit declarative `schemas/` and generate migrations as-needed before commits with `supabase db diff -f <label>`
